# Hi
I'm a researcher at Max-Planck-Institute for Meteorology. I'm driven to understand the mechanisms of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Specifically, my current research interests and activities include: 
1. Understanding the downward limb of the AMOC in depth and density space. 
2. Investigating the key processes that break meridional connectivity of ocean transports. 
3. Running storm- and eddy- resolving global coupled ICON simulations.
